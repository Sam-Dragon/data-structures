# Queue

- It works on the principle of FIFO [First In First Out] or LILO [Last In Last Out]
- It performs operations like
    - enqueue - inserting element into list
    - dequeue - deleting element from list
    - display - display the contents of the list

Limitations

- Once the deletion is performed, even if the queue gets empty.
  we cannot perform insertion again
